To the edito: 

In the report of the recent meeting of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic 
Association (MIAA) football committee, there is no evidence that the safety of 
the game received attention, yet the risk of serious injury, primarily permanent 
brain damage, is clearly responsible for the reported fall-off in Pee-Wee League 
participation, as well as the cancellation of the 2019 football season at 
Mt. Greylock Regional. 

Despite a violent and hyper-competitive, professionalized, yet still putatively amateur sporting environment, 
the health risks are still played down and softened in the National 
Federation of High Schools (NFHS) athletic registration process in use at MGRHS, 
and perhaps in other high schools served by the MIAA. The clearance 
forms signed by parents do not make the most serious risks explicit. 
They get some of the truth but not the whole truth. The 
content of these packaged registration processes need more careful evaluation to insure 
their scientific validity. 

If the claimed values conveyed by playing football are to be retained, 
the violence must be removed. The MIAA should be discussing the creation 
of a flag football league for Massachusetts high schools. Violence would be 
significantly reduced. Young women could play. And all this at reduced equipment 
cost and increased safety.
