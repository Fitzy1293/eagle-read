To the editor: 

So, now it's social isolation. 

Harder than my expectation. 

Aggravation! Consternation! 

Had to cancel every vacation. 

Missing Easter celebration. 

Our son's our shopper for the duration. 

He has our deep appreciation. 

Great to have a close-by relation. 

Then there's stay-at-home education. 

Living with lessons adaptation. 

Work to home relocation. 

Email and phone communication. 

Walks with friends dispel frustration. 

Health workers have my admiration. 

When this is done there'll be celebration. 

Jubilation! Exultation! 

Until then, we manage this tribulation.
