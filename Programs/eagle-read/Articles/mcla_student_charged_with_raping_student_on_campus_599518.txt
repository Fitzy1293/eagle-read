NORTH ADAMS — A Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts student has been 
charged with raping another student on campus, the college has confirmed. 

Christian Womble, 18, was charged as a result of an investigation conducted 
by the MCLA police. He has been suspended and barred from the 
campus. 

The date of the alleged assault was not provided by the college, 
but Womble was charged via criminal complaint on March 6. 

He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Northern Berkshire District Court 
in North Adams. 

Spokespersons with the college and the Berkshire District Attorney's Office declined to 
provide further information. 

Womble was a standout pitcher for the Taconic High School baseball team, 
leading the Braves last year to their second MIAA state baseball championship 
in three seasons and their third consecutive Western Massachusetts championship.
